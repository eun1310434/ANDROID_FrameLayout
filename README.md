Frame Layout
----------- 
FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.
Generally, FrameLayout should be used to hold a single child view,
because it can be difficult to organize child views in a way that's scalable to different screen sizes without the children overlapping each other.
You can, however, add multiple children to a FrameLayout and control their position within the FrameLayout by assigning gravity to each child, using the android:layout_gravity attribute.
